// This file contains the logic of every route in Forest Admin for the collection services:
// - Native routes are already generated but can be extended/overriden - Learn how to extend a route here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/routes/extend-a-route
// - Smart action routes will need to be added as you create new Smart Actions - Learn how to create a Smart Action here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/actions/create-and-manage-smart-actions

// Create a Service
router.post('/services', permissionMiddlewareCreator.create(), (request, response, next) => {
  // Learn what this route does here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/routes/default-routes#create-a-record

});

// Update a Service

  // Learn what this route does here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/routes/default-routes#update-a-record
  next();
});

// Delete a Service
router.delete('/services/:recordId', permissionMiddlewareCreator.delete(), (request, response, next) => {
  // Learn what this route does here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/routes/default-routes#delete-a-record
  next();
});

// Get a list of Services
router.get('/services', permissionMiddlewareCreator.list(), (request, response, next) => {
  // Learn what this route does here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/routes/default-routes#get-a-list-of-records
  next();
});

// Get a number of Services
router.get('/services/count', permissionMiddlewareCreator.list(), (request, response, next) => {
  // Learn what this route does here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/routes/default-routes#get-a-number-of-records

// Get a Service

  // Learn what this route does here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/routes/default-routes#get-a-record
